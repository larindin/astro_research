If items in a list are narrow like these Greek characters,\\
    \I2 \verb+$\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$+\\
I'd input the line like this\\
    \I2 \verb+$\alpha$,~$\beta$, and~$\gamma$+\\
where the \verb+~+ is a tie
that ties together what's before and after it on the same line of the output
\cite[page~92]{knuth2012}.

This text is the correct length to show what happens with and without ties:
$\alpha$,
$\beta$,
and $\gamma$.
See how the line gets split
and the~$\gamma$ is at the beginning of the line?

This text is the correct length to show what happens with and without ties:
$\alpha$,~$\beta$,
and~$\gamma$.
See how the line gets compressed a little bit so the~$\gamma$
is not at the beginning of the line?
