Be sure to sign up for the
\href{https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/mailman/listinfo/purduethesis-list}{\PurdueThesisLogo\ mailing list}%
\cite{PurdueThesis-mailing-list}
to learn of important changes to
or get help with \PurdueThesisLogo.

I suggest you do not make any changes
to the |PurdueThesis.cls| file.
Put any changes in the |thesis.tex| file if you can.
That way you will not need to add your customizations
when a new version of |PurdueThesis.cls| is released.
